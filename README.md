# Pathfinding

Welcome to my pathfinding demo written in Java.

The demo currently includes 2 pathfinding algorithms, the A* algorithm and Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm. I intend to add additional algorithms in the future.

Current development is focused on improving how the app runs, look and feel will be finalized when the project is otherwise technically sound. 

Questions and comments are welcome and appreciated, I am a student programmer and I am looking for every opportunity to improve my code.

- Note current version has been tested and does not display properly on OSX or Linux, support to come.
