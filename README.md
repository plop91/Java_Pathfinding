# Pathfinding

Welcome to my pathfinding demo written in Java.

The demo currently includes 2 pathfinding algorithms, the A* algorithm and Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm. I intend to add additional algorithms in the future.

Current development is focused on improving how the app runs, I am currently investigating java scheduled executor service as a way of scheduling the display refresh but may move to inter-thread communication.

Questions and comments are welcome and appreciated, I am a student programmer and I am looking for every opportunity to improve my code.
